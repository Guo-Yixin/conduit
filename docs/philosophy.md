# The Conduit Philosophy

Why this thing is shaped the way it is. [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) is the *what*; this is the
*why*. If a design decision ever seems arbitrary, it should trace back to one of the beliefs
below.

## The core bet: LLMs are labor, not a brain in the loop

The dominant way to build with LLMs right now is "one smart agent that reasons about
everything, with tools." Conduit bets the opposite: **the LLM is a worker at a station, not
the intelligence running the system.** The orchestration — what runs next, when, with what
capacity — is a deterministic state machine. The model only does two things: *work* (produce
something) and *check* (judge something).

This isn't a stylistic preference. We watched an LLM-driven orchestration loop run away for
40 hours without converging. The control flow of a work pipeline is a finite state machine;
paying a model to re-derive that FSM every cycle is expensive, slow, and — as it turns out —
unreliable. So we took the reasoning *out of the loop* and concentrated it where it earns
its keep: the work and the checks.

> **The conveyor is dumb on purpose.** Intelligence at the stations; determinism on the flow.

## It's a factory, not a chatbot — and not a DAG

Two camps own the agent conversation today: chat loops (agents talking until they stop) and
DAG pipelines (a fixed graph of prompt calls). Conduit is neither. It's a **flow-shop** — an
assembly line:

- work flows through **stations**, each with a worker and (sometimes) a quality gate;
- **WIP limits** cap how much is in each station at once;
- work is **pulled** when a station has capacity, not pushed;
- a failed quality check sends a piece **back down the flow** for rework;
- a piece that can't pass enough times goes to the **scrap bin** for a human;
- a runaway flow is stopped by an **andon cord**.

That vocabulary isn't decoration. Toyota solved the hard problems of high-throughput,
quality-controlled production decades ago — bounded rework, pull systems, stop-the-flow on
defect, mistake-proofing. The 40-hour runaway was simply *a flow with no andon cord and no
scrap bin*. We are porting lean manufacturing to knowledge work, not inventing orchestration
from scratch.

Crucially, a DAG **can't** express the most important part: the back-edge. `work → check →
reject → rework` is a *cycle*. DAG engines forbid cycles by construction, which is why
Conduit is a state machine, not Airflow.

## Every flow is a metabolism

A flow eats a raw substrate and excretes a finished product:

- A(i)-Team eats a PRD, excretes tested code.
- Studio eats an idea, excretes campaign assets.
- Autocut eats raw footage, excretes a polished video.

Same anatomy, different metabolism. The unit of value is the **transformation**, not the
intelligence. The engine doesn't care whether a station writes code, generates an image, or
runs `ffmpeg` — a station is just a transform with a contract. That indifference is exactly
what lets one kernel run any flow.

---

## Quality comes from the flow, not the model

This is the belief that makes everything else pay off. You do not get quality from a single
smart call; you get it from **make → inspect → revise**, with the maker and the inspector
kept separate (different prompt, often different model). The back-edge is what makes output
*converge* toward good instead of merely *happening once*.

And this is precisely what lets you run **cheap models**. A sharp critic covering for a
cheaper maker beats an expensive maker you never check. The flow is the mechanism that makes
frontier-quality output reachable with non-frontier labor. Cheap models, the flow, and
(eventually) a real market signal are not three features — they're one strategy.

---

## The law of checks

> **Check rigor is inversely proportional to how cheap, fast, and safe your external signal
> is.**

If reality grades you cheaply and quickly (an ad gets clicks or it doesn't), your internal
checks can be light — ship many, let the market sort them. If reality grades you slowly and
expensively (a bug reaches production), your internal checks must be heavy, because you can't
afford to "ship and measure." This single rule *predicts* the three flows: A(i)-Team has four
heavy gates (code's outer loop is brutal); Studio has two light ones (clicks are cheap);
Autocut sits in between.

One hard floor: the market only grades what it can see. It judges *taste* brilliantly and
*risk* not at all — an off-brand or non-compliant asset that happens to convert is still a
disaster. So checks split: **taste checks** thin as your signal cheapens; **risk checks**
(brand, safety, legal) stay mandatory regardless.

---

## Model independence is a first principle, not a feature

Frontier-only is a dead end for high-volume work — on cost, and on lock-in. Conduit drives
*any* model, chosen **per station**: frontier where judgment lives, cheap or local where it
doesn't. That's also a cost-engineering lever, because the cost of an LLM flow is dominated
by *input context and expensive-artifact output*, not reasoning — so you spend tokens where
they buy quality and starve them everywhere else.

This is why Conduit is its own runtime and not a plugin on someone else's harness. A flow you
can't run on the model you choose, at the cost you need, isn't yours.

---

## The Unix lineage

A transform station is a Unix filter: `stdin → process → stdout`, composable, testable with a
fixture, cacheable. A flow is a declarative pipe: `idea | brief | direct | generate |
assemble > campaign.csv`. Conduit is **Unix pipes plus the three things pipes can't do** —
quality gates, bounded back-edges, and WIP. Where the pipe analogy breaks is the one station
that's stateful and interactive (the agentic, tool-using worker); everything else is a
filter in a stream. Keep the filters pure and the flow stays simple.

---

## Escalate ambiguity; never guess. The Law is load-bearing.

When state is contradictory or recovery is unclear, the kernel **hard-pauses and asks a
human** — it does not auto-reverse or auto-guess. Forward-only across waves; no "nuclear
reversal" that rots state.

And because Conduit runs its own runtime with no provider safety net, **the Law — enforcement
hooks, path ownership, the allowlist — is the only guardrail.** It is not optional and it is
not best-effort. A disabled hook is how a flow learns to `rm -rf` the wrong directory; we've
seen it. The Law gets unit tests like any load-bearing code.

---

## The moat is flow design

If quality comes from the flow and the model is interchangeable, then the durable advantage
isn't the prompts and isn't the model — it's the **flow**: which stations, what each one's
definition-of-done is, where the checks sit, how rework routes. Domain expertise gets
encoded as *topology and check rubrics*, not one giant system prompt. **The flow is config;
the kernel is the product.** "I know how to make great X" becomes "here is the flow that
makes great X."

---

## What Conduit is *not* (anti-goals)

- **Not an autonomous agent.** No model decides what the system does next; the kernel does.
- **Not a chatbot.** State lives in a database and a board, not a conversation transcript.
- **Not a DAG runner.** The rework back-edge is the point; acyclic engines can't express it.
- **Not frontier-only.** Cheap-model viability is a design target, not an afterthought.
- **Not host-locked.** It owns its runtime so it can own its model and its cost.
- **Not self-modifying.** Kaizen *proposes* improvements; a human (or a passing test) gates
  every change. A self-modifying flow is a self-degrading flow.

---

## Lineage

Conduit didn't start as a theory. It's the kernel that three independently-built systems —
A(i)-Team (code), Studio (marketing images), Autocut (video) — converged on without trying:
the same deterministic controller, the same lane-in-a-state-file, the same resume-reconcile,
the same capped creator/critic rework. When you build the same architecture three times for
three unrelated domains, that's not a coincidence; it's a kernel asking to be extracted.
Conduit is the extraction.
