/**
 * Kernel-mediated model-call seam (WI-296).
 *
 * Workers NEVER reach the network directly.  They call ctx.adapter.call(...)
 * and the kernel adapter resolves the provider, applies rate-limits, and
 * returns the typed response.  This indirection lets tests inject a stub
 * without touching any real API endpoint.
 *
 * NETWORK-EGRESS ENFORCEMENT BOUNDARY (SPEC §7, agentic step 9 — no coverage
 * here): this adapter is a CALL-ROUTING seam, not an egress firewall. The
 * guarantee that a content-processing worker cannot reach the network
 * (`network_egress: deny`) is enforced at the HARNESS / Linux network-namespace
 * layer — the kernel spawns agentic workers via `unshare --net`, so the
 * subprocess has no external interfaces regardless of what adversarial substrate
 * instructs it to attempt. Nothing in this file blocks, allowlists, or inspects
 * network traffic; do NOT read this seam as providing egress containment. The
 * model call itself is made by the kernel process on the worker's behalf, which
 * is precisely what lets egress stay denied for the worker while LLM calls still
 * succeed.
